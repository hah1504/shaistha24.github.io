								<h3 class="major">My Story</h3>
								<p>I am a self-taught AI enthusiast. Currently, an MCA student, my first exposure to AI, specifically Deep Learning not so long ago, was through Udacityâ€™s Scholarship program. followed by the SPAI (Secure and Private AI ) Challenge, for which I was one of the 300 scholars to be selected for the Nanodegree Scholarship - Computer Vision. Currently, I am part of the Udacity Intel Edge Scholarship Challenge and Facebook Deep Learning Challenge. </p>
								<p>The scholarship program - Computer Vision did have some fun fundamental projects like - facial keypoint recognition, object detection in an image and 2-D lane directions BUT the best part was how much of an impact it has made to my personal life, teaching me the importance of community involvement and leadership skills ( Student Leader of #women_who_code channel) and teamwork.</p>
								<p>Luckily, I could grab an AI internship project ( Prashikshan ) at Tata Steel, which in turn has given me profound exposure to the industrial level applications of AI and the difficulties faced during that period. For me, it was a lack of proper data, as it is a new project.  The project mainly focuses on Anomaly Detection and Health Monitoring of the DC Rot. Motors based on their input currents with future scope for predictive maintenance, which lit my interest in Signal Processing ( used it for better Data Visualization and understanding ).</p>
								<p>I am still learning, and looking forward to the opportunities to work on real-world projects with an aim to make a significant contribution to the community.</p>
